*Conservation for nuclei over substructural entailment relations*

<pr>
Glivenko’s theorem has been studied in an abstract setting, where
double negation is replaced by arbitrary nuclei, and classical
and intuitionistic propositional logics are generalised to
abstract entailment relations. This paper extends that framework
to substructural logics, focusing on cases where structural rules
such as weakening, contraction, and exchange are restricted. We
show that while the absence of weakening or contraction has
minimal impact; the absence of the exchange rule introduces
significant and nontrivial distinctions.  This is a joint work
with Tarmo Uustalu and Cheng-Syuan Wan.</pr>

We show how an ordering of specific universes may lead to a sort of ordinals. Afterwards present two ways how to extend Explicit Mathematics by ordinals in a natural and powerful way.</pr>

*Cut elimination for a non-wellfounded system for the master modality*

<pr>
In [1], we provided a method for eliminating cuts in non-wellfounded proofs with a local-progress condition, these being the simplest kind of non-wellfounded proofs. The method consisted of splitting the proof into nicely behaved fragments. This paper extends our method to proofs based on simple trace conditions. The main idea is to split the system with the trace condition into infinitely many local-progress calculi that together are equivalent to the original trace-based system. This provides a cut-elimination method using only basic tools of structural proof theory and corecursion, which is needed due to working in a non-wellfounded setting. We will employ our method to obtain syntactic cut-elimination for K+, a system of modal logic with the master modality. </pr>

*Higher-Level Natural Deduction and Subformula Property for Kreisel-Putnam Logic*

<pr>
We introduce a new natural deduction system for Kreisel-Putnam logic. Our system is based on Schroeder-Heister's calculus of higher-level rules, an extension of ordinary natural deduction in which not only formulas, but also rules can act as assumptions that may be discharged in the course of a derivation. We will establish a normalization theorem, i.e., we will show that every deduction in our system can be converted into a deduction without "detours". The method used for this is new and might also be applied to other non-classical logics. As a consequence of this result, we will obtain an unrestricted subformula property and a separation theorem for our system. </pr>

*Simplicial Models for Epistemic Logic*

<pr>
Simplicial models originated in distributed computing, serving as a tool to study task solvability. They also provide a fresh view of the semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic. The main building blocks of simplicial models are local states of agents instead of (global) possible worlds. This change of perspective leads to novel logical operators and makes new applications possible. In this talk, we will provide an introduction to simplicial models and present recent developments. </pr>

“Conservation for nuclei over substructural entailment relations”

Glivenko’s theorem has been studied in an abstract setting, where
double negation is replaced by arbitrary nuclei, and classical
and intuitionistic propositional logics are generalised to
abstract entailment relations. This paper extends that framework
to substructural logics, focusing on cases where structural rules
such as weakening, contraction, and exchange are restricted. We
show that while the absence of weakening or contraction has
minimal impact; the absence of the exchange rule introduces
significant and nontrivial distinctions.  This is a joint work
