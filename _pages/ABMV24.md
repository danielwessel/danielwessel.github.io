*Conservation for nuclei over substructural entailment relations*

<pr>
Glivenko’s theorem has been studied in an abstract setting, where
double negation is replaced by arbitrary nuclei, and classical
and intuitionistic propositional logics are generalised to
abstract entailment relations. This paper extends that framework
to substructural logics, focusing on cases where structural rules
such as weakening, contraction, and exchange are restricted. We
show that while the absence of weakening or contraction has
minimal impact; the absence of the exchange rule introduces
significant and nontrivial distinctions.  This is a joint work
with Tarmo Uustalu and Cheng-Syuan Wan.</pr>

*Explicit Mathematics: Universes and Ordinals*

<pr>
We show how an ordering of specific universes may lead to a sort of ordinals. Afterwards present two ways how to extend Explicit Mathematics by ordinals in a natural and powerful way.</pr>

*From Computing to AI. Logical, Mathematical, Technical, and Philosophical Foundations*

<pr> 
Technical-practical limits of today's computers and AI depend on the theoretical foundation of digital computability. On the basis of digital computability, symbolic AI was initially oriented towards the logical reasoning of symbolic logic. Statistical learning from big data led to machine learning, which dominates the techno-economic breakthroughs of AI today. Some limits of digital computability, decidability and solvability of problems can be theoretically overcome beyond Turing computability with real computing. Novel analog computer architectures orientated towards the human brain enable its technical-practical realization. An extension to hybrid AI is requested for, combining digital, analog and real computing in neuromorphic computing structures. These tendencies of research and innovation demonstrate that we need more integrated research in the foundations of logic, mathematics, physics, engineering sciences, cognitive science, and philosophy.</pr>

*Cut elimination for a non-wellfounded system for the master modality*

<pr>
In [1], we provided a method for eliminating cuts in non-wellfounded proofs with a local-progress condition, these being the simplest kind of non-wellfounded proofs. The method consisted of splitting the proof into nicely behaved fragments. This paper extends our method to proofs based on simple trace conditions. The main idea is to split the system with the trace condition into infinitely many local-progress calculi that together are equivalent to the original trace-based system. This provides a cut-elimination method using only basic tools of structural proof theory and corecursion, which is needed due to working in a non-wellfounded setting. We will employ our method to obtain syntactic cut-elimination for K+, a system of modal logic with the master modality. </pr>

*Higher-Level Natural Deduction and Subformula Property for Kreisel-Putnam Logic*

<pr>
We introduce a new natural deduction system for Kreisel-Putnam logic. Our system is based on Schroeder-Heister's calculus of higher-level rules, an extension of ordinary natural deduction in which not only formulas, but also rules can act as assumptions that may be discharged in the course of a derivation. We will establish a normalization theorem, i.e., we will show that every deduction in our system can be converted into a deduction without "detours". The method used for this is new and might also be applied to other non-classical logics. As a consequence of this result, we will obtain an unrestricted subformula property and a separation theorem for our system. </pr>

*A recursion-theoretic characterization of monotone NP*

Part of the research in circuit complexity since the 1970s has been devoted to proving lower bounds in restricted circuit classes. A famous example is Razborov's lower bound for monotone circuits, where only AND and OR gates are allowed. To give a unified theory of monotone computation, Grigni and Sipser extended the notion of monotonicity beyond circuits and defined monotone non-deterministic Turing machines. These are non-deterministic Turing machines which are monotone on their input tape, but are allowed to perform negative operations on their work tapes and non-deterministically generated bits. Under this formalism, Razborov's result can be stated as "monotone P is strictly contained in monotone NP". In this talk, I will introduce a new computational model of monotone non-determinism, where only monotone operations are allowed, and show that, with polynomial time bounds, one still obtains Grigni and Sipser's monotone NP. Based on this model, I will present a characterization of monotone NP as the closure of a set of basic functions under three operators.

*Simplicial Models for Epistemic Logic*

<pr>
Simplicial models originated in distributed computing, serving as a tool to study task solvability. They also provide a fresh view of the semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic. The main building blocks of simplicial models are local states of agents instead of (global) possible worlds. This change of perspective leads to novel logical operators and makes new applications possible. In this talk, we will provide an introduction to simplicial models and present recent developments. </pr>
