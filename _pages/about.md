Hi there! Thank you for visiting this website.

I am a mathematician based in Munich, with research interests in constructive maths, point-free topology, and proof theory.

Currently, I'm Postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~wessel/" target="_blank">Mathematical Institute of LMU</a>.
In 2023/24 I was fellow at the <a href="https://www.wiko-greifswald.de/fellows/alfried-krupp-fellows-programm/fellows-finden/2023-2024/misselbeck-wessel-daniel-phd/" target="_blank">Alfried Krupp Institute for Advanced Study</a>, 
and guest lecturer at the University of Greifswald's Faculty of Arts and Humanities.



<!--I studied in Berlin, Munich, Trento, and Verona, where I obtained a PhD and carried out postdoctoral work. Currently, I am taking time off academia that is devoted to care work.

In the academic year 2023/24 I will be fellow at the Alfried Krupp Institute for Advanced Study, 
aiming to reignite research on Gentzen's *Nachlass*.-->
