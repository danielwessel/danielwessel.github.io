This paper extends that framework to substructural logics, focusing on cases where structural rules such as weakening, contraction, and exchange are restricted. We show that while the absence of weakening or contraction has minimal impact; the absence of the exchange rule introduces significant and nontrivial distinctions. This is a joint work with Tarmo Uustalu and Cheng-Syuan Wan.</pr> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Luis Gambarte</strong> (LMU Munich)<br> <em>Categorical constructions on computability models</em></p> <pr> The notion of a computability model was introduced by Longley as a way to abstract different concepts in theoretical computer science and logic like typed partial combinatory algebras or λ-calculus. We explore the existence (or lack thereof) of standard categorical constructions in the category of these computability models and compare them to the same constructions in related categories. Furthermore we give a brief exposition of categories with computability bases and how they can be related to computability models.</pr> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Gerhard Jäger</strong> (University of Bern)<br> <em>Explicit Mathematics: Universes and Ordinals</em></p> <pr> We show how an ordering of specific universes may lead to a sort of ordinals.

Logical, Mathematical, Technical, and Philosophical Foundations</em></p> <pr> Technical-practical limits of today's computers and AI depend on the theoretical foundation of digital computability. On the basis of digital computability, symbolic AI was initially oriented towards the logical reasoning of symbolic logic. Statistical learning from big data led to machine learning, which dominates the techno-economic breakthroughs of AI today. Some limits of digital computability, decidability and solvability of problems can be theoretically overcome beyond Turing computability with real computing. Novel analog computer architectures orientated towards the human brain enable its technical-practical realization. An extension to hybrid AI is requested for, combining digital, analog and real computing in neuromorphic computing structures. These tendencies of research and innovation demonstrate that we need more integrated research in the foundations of logic, mathematics, physics, engineering sciences, cognitive science, and philosophy.</pr> <p>References: K.

Our system is based on Schroeder-Heister's calculus of higher-level rules, an extension of ordinary natural deduction in which not only formulas, but also rules can act as assumptions that may be discharged in the course of a derivation. We will establish a normalization theorem, i.e., we will show that every deduction in our system can be converted into a deduction without "detours". The method used for this is new and might also be applied to other non-classical logics. As a consequence of this result, we will obtain an unrestricted subformula property and a separation theorem for our system. </pr> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Takako Nemoto</strong> (Tohoku University)<br> <em>(not weak) Konig’s lemma and fan theorem</em></p> <pr> In [1], it is proved that weak Konig's lemma with uniqueness condition WKL! is equivalent to the decidable binary fan theorem. Analogously, we can prove that KL! implies the decidable (non-binary) fan theorem, but the converse seems difficult. In this talk, we will show these analogy and difficulty, and related principles.

Free logics are a family of first-order logics which came about as a result of examining the existence assumptions of classical logic. They specifically reject the claim that every name needs to denote an object. Of the three major variants, positive free logic concedes that some atomic formulas containing non-denoting names (including at least self-identity) are true, negative free logic treats them as uniformly false, and neutral free logic as taking a third value (with further sub-variants depending on the interpretation of that third value). These various logics also have complex and varied axiomatizations and semantics, but are more easily brought into a unified framework using the methods of proof theory. We present these systems for all three variants, discuss their properties and examine applications of those.</pr> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Iosif Petrakis</strong> (University of Verona)<br> <em>Apart algebras</em></p> <pr> Sambin and Ciraulo developed the theory of overlap algebras as an algebraic generalisation of the overlap relation between subsets. Overlap algebras correspond classically to complete Boolean algebras and intuitionistically to complete Heyting algebras. We introduce apart algebras as an algebraic generalisation of the apart relation between subsets. The duality between the overlap and the apart relation between subsets is extended to the duality between the theory of overlap and apart algebras. While overlap algebras induce a canonical positivity predicate and are formal topologies, apart algebras induce a canonical negativity predicate and are formal cotopologies. While the regular elements of an overlap topology form an overlap algebra, the coregular elements of an apart topology form an apart algebra. </pr> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Borja Sierra-Miranda</strong> (University of Bern)<br> <em>Cut elimination for a non-wellfounded system for the master modality</em></p> <pr> In [1], we provided a method for eliminating cuts in non-wellfounded proofs with a local-progress condition, these being the simplest kind of non-wellfounded proofs. The method consisted of splitting the proof into nicely behaved fragments. This paper extends our method to proofs based on simple trace conditions. The main idea is to split the system with the trace condition into infinitely many local-progress calculi that together are equivalent to the original trace-based system. This provides a cut-elimination method using only basic tools of structural proof theory and corecursion, which is needed due to working in a non-wellfounded setting. We will employ our method to obtain syntactic cut-elimination for K+, a system of modal logic with the master modality. </pr> <p>[1]: Borja Sierra Miranda, Thomas Studer and Lukas Zenger. “Coalgebraic Proof Translations of Non-Wellfounded Proofs”.

College Publications.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Eduardo Skapinakis</strong> (University of Tübingen)<br> <em>A recursion-theoretic characterization of monotone NP</em></p> <p>Part of the research in circuit complexity since the 1970s has been devoted to proving lower bounds in restricted circuit classes. A famous example is Razborov’s lower bound for monotone circuits, where only AND and OR gates are allowed. To give a unified theory of monotone computation, Grigni and Sipser extended the notion of monotonicity beyond circuits and defined monotone non-deterministic Turing machines. These are non-deterministic Turing machines which are monotone on their input tape, but are allowed to perform negative operations on their work tapes and non-deterministically generated bits. Under this formalism, Razborov’s result can be stated as “monotone P is strictly contained in monotone NP”. In this talk, I will introduce a new computational model of monotone non-determinism, where only monotone operations are allowed, and show that, with polynomial time bounds, one still obtains Grigni and Sipser’s monotone NP. Based on this model, I will present a characterization of monotone NP as the closure of a set of basic functions under three operators.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Thomas Studer</strong> (University of Bern)<br> <em>Simplicial Models for Epistemic Logic</em></p> <pr> Simplicial models originated in distributed computing, serving as a tool to study task solvability. They also provide a fresh view of the semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic. The main building blocks of simplicial models are local states of agents instead of (global) possible worlds. This change of perspective leads to novel logical operators and makes new applications possible. In this talk, we will provide an introduction to simplicial models and present recent developments. </pr> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Franziskus Wiesnet</strong> (TU Wien)<br> <em>Material Interpretation - A Case Study</em></p> <pr> We explore the constructive characterization of all maximal ideals in ℤ[X], which serves as a case study for the concept of the "Material Interpretation". Starting with a classical proof, we demonstrate how it can be transformed into a constructive proof, potentially leading to stronger statements. The Material Interpretation provides an alternative proof interpretation, transforming statements of the form A → B into ¬A ∨ B, where ¬A represents a constructively stronger form of the negation of A. We will discuss the theoretical foundations of this approach as well as its formalization in the proof assistant Agda, which is still a work in progress. Furthermore we highlight Agda's capabilities for automating the Material Interpretation and share improvements to its library through the addition of valuable theorems.</pr> <p><br></p> <h3> Accommodation </h3> <p><a href="https://www.pension-josefine.de" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Pension Josefine</a> (Nordendstraße 13)<br> <a href="https://www.antares-muenchen.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Hotel Antares</a> (Amalienstraße 20)</p> <p><br></p> <h3> Contact </h3> <p><a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Helmut Schwichtenberg</a><br> <a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~wessel/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Daniel Misselbeck-Wessel</a></p> <p><br></p> <p><em>Last modified: Monday, 25 November 2024</em></p> </body></html>
